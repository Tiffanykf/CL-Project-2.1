  <div class="section">
    <p>In every like, comment, and shared post, we reach for each other through our screens. But our constant search for connection is only ever in the abstract; we interact with artifacts left behind by other digital visitors.</p>
    <p>What if you could feel the presence of someone beyond your screen? Let your cursor drift around obstacles until you feel the magnetic pull of another. When you’re close, a yellow circle will appear exactly halfway between your paths and music will start to play. Wander together and the music will flow, but move slowly — there’s nothing cursory about this connection.</p>
    <p>Ready to meet?</p>
